Hello.
This is the first post from the scala-based poker casino coding series.
The main idea is to provide you and give a practical excpetienc to me about scala-based project creating: the language, platform, functional programming paradigms, tools to develop and deploy, testing, etc.

I am a Java developer and I used to program in OOP paradigms. Scala in general and a functional programming in a particular are new for me, so I can make some newbie mistakes and ugly code at first several weeks. 

Also I like TDD programming style, but can skip tests on first, educational development stages.

About the project: I would like to write scala based Hold'em Texas Poker casino in Coding DOJO style (when you are appreciate to write computer programs that compete opponent programs). That is why I prefer REST and websockets to templating and will use something like spray on the web layer.

I will try to manage my time to deliver new posts and code on the regular basics. And in the next post I will create some new code repository for project and will make some code in there :)
