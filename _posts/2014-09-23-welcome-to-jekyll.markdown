This would be my first post on this my new blog.

Now I am new, but really glad to use to `jekyll` as a static html from markdown generator. Also I am new to practical use of markdown, but it is amazing!  I can make my posts in sublime and upload them dirrectly from terminal to github, that immediatly hooks them to the web! Fantastic!
All my blog is a repository in my github account. 

I think that this blog should be about some new technologies and technics I use in my daily work and pet-projects.
I will try to cover some topics and questions, that I think would be interesting to me and public.

So, stay in touch. I hope, to fill this blog on regular basis.
